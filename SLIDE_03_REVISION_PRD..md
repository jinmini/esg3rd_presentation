## 1. Strategic Goal: From "Problem Teller" to "Problem Solver"

### 1.1. The "Why" Behind This Revision

Our target audience (executives, investors) is already aware of the general market problems like "ESG regulations are complex" or "AI is important". Simply repeating these facts is not persuasive enough.

We need to elevate our message. Instead of just stating the problem, we must demonstrate a **deep, expert-level understanding of the client's specific workflow and pain points**. Our goal is to reframe this slide from a general market overview to a powerful demonstration of our unique, targeted approach.

We are not just another ESG tool; we are **specialists who have pinpointed the most critical bottleneck** in the ESG reporting process.

### 1.2. Core Message to Convey

"While others focus on generic data collection, we target the most painful and time-consuming part of your job: the **Double Materiality Assessment** and its direct link to creating the final **Report Draft**. We use GenAI to turn this bottleneck into your competitive advantage."

## 2. Functional Requirements for `03-market-opportunity.html`

### 2.1. Depict the Entire ESG Reporting Workflow

- The slide must visually represent the standard, end-to-end ESG reporting "mega-process".
- This workflow should serve as the foundational visual context for the entire slide.
- **Example Steps**: `Policy Analysis` → `Double Materiality Assessment` → `Data Collection` → `Performance Analysis` → `Report Drafting` → `Disclosure`

### 2.2. Contrast Our Solution Against the "Old Way"

- The design must visually distinguish between the general, less effective approach of existing solutions and our highly focused, effective approach.
- **Show, don't just tell**: Clearly indicate where traditional solutions fall short within the workflow.

### 2.3. Spotlight Our Core Strength: The "Golden Path"

- The absolute focal point of the slide must be our core value proposition.
- Visually and conceptually, there must be a **strong, undeniable link** between the `Double Materiality Assessment` stage and the `Report Drafting` stage.
- This "Golden Path" is what we uniquely automate. The slide's design must celebrate this connection.

### 2.4. Detail Our Key Capabilities

- The slide must clearly list our three key strengths that enable this "Golden Path":
  1.  Simplified Double Materiality Assessment
  2.  Automated Strategy Derivation from Core Issues
  3.  GenAI-Powered Report Draft Generation

### 2.5. Include Social Proof

- A customer testimonial should be included to validate our claims.
- The quote should be updated to be more specific to our core strength.
- **Example Quote**: `"The materiality assessment used to take us weeks. With this platform, we get from data to strategic insights and a first draft in hours, not days."`

## 3. Creative & Design Freedom (Claude's Expertise Zone)

**This is where we trust your expertise.** I have defined the "What" and "Why". I am giving you complete creative freedom on the "How" – the visual implementation.

- **Your Challenge**: How do you best represent this story visually?
- **Be Bold**: Do not feel constrained by the previous card-based layout. A complete redesign is encouraged.
- **Possible Ideas (for inspiration only, not as strict instructions)**:
  - A large, central workflow diagram?
  - A "before vs. after" comparison?
  - A "spotlight" effect that highlights our core focus area while dimming the rest?
  - A funnel visual, showing how broad problems are funneled into our specific, elegant solution?
- **Surprise me.** Create a design that is clear, professional, and visually compelling, effectively telling the story outlined in this document. The final design should be intuitive and communicate our expertise instantly.

## 4. Final Deliverables

1.  The complete, redesigned HTML code for `slides/03-market-opportunity.html`.
2.  Any necessary additions or modifications to `/assets/common.css` to support the new design.
