# [PRD] Design for Slide 04: The Automated Materiality Engine

- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Context**: This slide follows our new slide 03, which claimed we solve the "Double Materiality Assessment" bottleneck. This slide must now answer "HOW?" by showcasing our unique, automated process.
- **Core Insight**: I've provided the actual React code for our product. It reveals a sophisticated, 5-step process for materiality assessment that is compliant with ESRS standards. This is our key technical differentiator.

## 1. Strategic Goal

To visually demonstrate our proprietary 5-step automated materiality assessment process, building technical credibility and proving our claim from the previous slide. We must translate the complexity of the provided code into a simple, powerful, and persuasive visual story.

## 2. Core Narrative: "From Data to Decision in 5 Automated Steps"

The slide should tell the story of how raw, chaotic data is transformed into a clear, strategic materiality matrix through our "engine."

## 3. Key Components to Visualize

1.  **The 5-Step Process**: This is the backbone of the slide. The five steps derived from the code are:
    1.  `Issue Pool Management`
    2.  `Scoring`
    3.  `Stakeholder Input`
    4.  `Threshold Setting`
    5.  `Matrix Confirmation`

2.  **ESRS Compliance**: The "Scoring" step is special. It follows the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) by separating "Impact Materiality" and "Financial Materiality". This **must be highlighted** as a proof of our global standard compliance and expertise.

3.  **The "Input"**: Show various unstructured data sources (news, reports, etc.) flowing into the first step.

4.  **The "Output"**: The process must culminate in a clear, final deliverable: the **Double Materiality Matrix**.

5.  **The "Benefits"**: The tangible benefits of this process (time saved, objectivity, compliance) must be clearly summarized.

## 4. Creative & Design Freedom (Claude's Expertise Zone)

I trust your creative expertise to bring this to life. Here are some concepts for inspiration, but feel free to invent a better approach.

-   **"The Machine/Engine" Concept**: Visualize the 5 steps as interconnected parts of a sophisticated machine or engine. Data goes in one end, and the final matrix comes out the other.
-   **"The Conveyor Belt" Concept**: Show the process as a conveyor belt, where each of the 5 stations adds value and refines the data until it becomes the final output.
-   **Visual Emphasis**:
    -   The **"Scoring" step (Step 2) should be the most visually prominent and complex part** of the engine, perhaps with a special "ESRS Compliant" badge on it.
    -   The final **output (the Matrix) should be presented as the clear, valuable "jewel"** that emerges from the process.

## 5. Final Deliverables

1.  The complete, redesigned HTML code for `slides/04-competitive-landscape.html` (which we will now rename to something like `04-materiality-engine.html`).
2.  Any necessary additions to `common.css` to support this new, highly visual, and potentially animated design.
